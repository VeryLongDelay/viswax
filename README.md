# Viswax

A quick and dirty github actions task to scrape the data from Runescape forums to get the [Vis wax](https://runescape.wiki/w/Vis_wax) combinations daily, thanks to [0vertime's][1] and [Tiamat rider's][2] threads.

Data is being updated every half hour automatically thanks to the magic of Github Actions.

Jagex give us an actual api, please.
